The lists of names and/or email addresses provided by users to join email forums/discussion lists at this site are used only for the operation and maintenance of these forums/discussion lists. Web forms will be used only for the specific purposes described with these forms, and input on these forms is considered private, unless the form data is specifically for submitting information for public viewing (e.g. forums/discussion list message input, or otherwise specified as public on any specific form), or if the user has specified otherwise.</p>
			<p style="padding:15px">Messages sent via email to the public submission addresses for forums/discussion lists at this site are assumed to be for possible public distribution unless the sender indicates otherwise. Such messages distributed publicly may also be made available in archives related to those forums/discussion lists, and will normally include the sender's name and email address as provided in their email header.</p>

The detailed data entries in these logs are used only for server and network operation and maintenance, and are considered to be private. Cookies may be used by some servers at this site and/or by linked third-party sites for system control and management functions.</p>
